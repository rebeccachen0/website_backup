## Supernovae in redMaGiC galaxies

Cosmological analyses with Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) typically rely heavily on spectroscopy to both classify the type of the supernova and obtain redshifts from either the supernova or its host galaxy. Upcoming photometric surveys such as LSST and Roman will observe more than a million SNe (compared to the ~1800 in our current largest compilations), for which obtaining spectroscopy for every event is unfeasible. I have worked on a novel approach to this problem, which focuses on SNe Ia hosted in redMaGiC galaxies, a selection of Luminous Red Galaxies that has traditionally been used in large-scale structure studies. redMaGiC galaxies are selected to have minimal photometric redshift estimate uncertainties and are expected to have very low rates of core-collapse supernovae. The subset of SNe in LRGs also presents a unique opportunity to better understand the relationship between host-galaxy properties and SN light properties, as LRGs are passive and nearly dust-free. In my [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10480), we present the method and results of this first proof-of-concept analysis that lays the groundwork for the use of photometric redshifts for SNe Ia cosmology.

## Host-galaxy photometric redshifts for Ia Cosmology

An alternative to using the host-galaxy photometric redshift directly in the Hubble Diagram is to use it as a prior for fitting a photo-z from the supernova light curve itself. I'm currently working on a project to quantify potential cosmological biases when using a few photo-z estimation methods with the goal of performing a full photo-z SNIa cosmology analysis.
