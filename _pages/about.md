Hi! I'm Rebecca, a Physics PhD candidate at Duke University working with Prof. Dan Scolnic on Type Ia Supernova (SNIa) cosmology. I'm an active member of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Collaboration, and my thesis work is focused on using photometric redshifts for SNIa cosmological analyses, either from the host galaxy or the SN itself. To do so effectively, I'm interested in leveraging the techniques and expertise developed from other cosmological probes that have already long been reliant on photometric redshifts, such as weak lensing and large scale structure. To this end, I'm also interested in all things related to host-galaxy systematics and Ia standardization.

I did my undergraduate at the University of Chicago, where I worked with Prof. Chihway Chang on projects in weak lensing and was a member of the first graduating class of Astronomy and Astrophysics majors! I also spent a summer at the historic Yerkes Observatory, as well as a summer at the Academic Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics in Taipei.

Outside of academia, I am also invested in learning about the ways in which we can use data science methods to improve social equity and impact, and am actively looking for volunteer or part-time positions, particularly in climate and food systems. In my spare time, I enjoy reading, cooking and baking, sewing and knitting my own wardrobe, and board games.
